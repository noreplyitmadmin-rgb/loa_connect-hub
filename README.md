# LOA Connect Hub

Academic consultation management system built with **Next.js 16**, **Supabase**, and **Tailwind CSS 4**.

## Architecture

### Database

Supabase PostgreSQL. Tables created via `supabase-schema.sql` (run in Supabase SQL Editor).

### MS Teams Integration

Optional — guarded by `FEATURE_CREATE_TEAMS_MEETING` flag. Sync tracking fields on `Appointment` (`teamsSyncStatus`, `teamsSyncRetries`, etc.) with a cron-triggered endpoint at `POST /api/admin/sync-teams`.

### Data Flow

```
Browser HTTP Request
    ↓
proxy.ts (NextAuth Middleware) — JWT validation, mobile-UA redirect, role-based page access
    ↓
Next.js App Router / API Routes
    ↓
API Route Handler (thin) — parse request, call controller, return JSON
    ↓
Controller (features/*/*.controller.ts) — orchestration, cross-domain aggregation, DTO shaping
    ↓
Service (features/*/*.service.ts) — business logic, validation, single-domain data fetching
    ↓
Repository (features/*/*.repository.ts) — data access via Supabase REST API
    ↓
Supabase PostgreSQL
```

Server Components fetch data directly via controllers (or services for simpler lookups) and pass props to Client Components.

### Current Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Routing** | Next.js App Router — file-based, route groups, dynamic `[id]` routes |
| **Auth** | NextAuth v4 (Credentials provider, JWT, bcryptjs) |
| **Authorization** | Middleware (`proxy.ts`) + per-route `auth()` calls + DB role checks |
| **Data access** | Repository pattern with interface abstraction |
| **Layered architecture** | Controller orchestrates cross-domain logic + DTO shaping; service handles pure business logic and single-domain data fetching; repository handles data access |
| **Roles** | Multi-role via pipe-delimited string in `user.role`; resolved by priority (ADMIN > DEAN > FACULTY > STUDENT); Faculty ⇔ Dean mutually exclusive |
| **UI state** | React built-in hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`); no global state library |
| **Forms** | Local `useState`; `SubmitButton` double-click prevention |
| **Email** | Nodemailer (Gmail SMTP), durable via Vercel Workflows with sequenced steps |
| **iCal** | Custom `.ics` generation (no library) |
| **CSV import** | Custom parser in `lib/services/` |
| **PDF export** | jsPDF + jspdf-autotable (dynamically imported on click) |
| **Code splitting** | `next/dynamic` for tab-based report content; chart/schedule/summary views loaded on tab activation |
| **Batch DB ops** | `Promise.all` for parallel slot/attendee creation and conflict checks instead of sequential `for...of` + `await` |
| **Feature flags** | Environment variables (`EMAIL_FEATURE_FLAG`, `SSO_FEATURE_FLAG`, etc.) |
| **Loading states** | Dedicated skeleton components + `loading.tsx` per route segment |
| **Dark mode** | Class-based (`.dark` on `<html>`), persisted in localStorage, Tailwind v4 `@custom-variant dark` |

### File Count

| Directory | Source Files |
|-----------|-------------|
| `app/` | 174 (pages, API routes, layouts, error boundaries, loading states) |
| `features/` | 120 (controllers, services, repos, actions, domain components) |
| `components/` | 23 (global React components in ui/ + layouts/) |
| `lib/` | 63 (types, utils, tests, services, repos factory, workflows, email) |
| `hooks/` | 2 |
| `types/` | 1 |
| Total | ~398 source files |

### Page Rendering Strategy

Pages use one of three patterns depending on interactivity needs:

| Pattern | Count | How it works |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Server Component** | 20 | `async function` page imports controller/service directly, fetches data during SSR, passes props to client children |
| **Client Component** | 22 | `"use client"` page calls API routes via `fetch`/custom hooks for data and mutations |
| **Redirect / Static** | 10 | Redirect-only (`redirect()`) or static UI with no data fetching |

| Route | Pattern | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `/` | Redirect | Conditional redirect based on session/role |
| `/403` | Static | Forbidden page |
| `/faq` | Server | Imports lib directly |
| `/login` | Client | Auth form |
| `/activate` | Client | Account activation form |
| `/forgot-password` | Client | Password reset form |
| `/change-password` | Client | Password change form |
| `/admin` | Server | Dashboard — imports services |
| `/admin/reports` | Redirect | → `/admin/reports/health` |
| `/admin/reports/health` | Server | Imports `admin-reports.controller` |
| `/admin/reports/backlog` | Server | Imports `backlog.controller` |
| `/admin/reports/coverage` | Server | Imports `coverage.controller` |
| `/admin/reports/distribution` | Server | Imports `distribution.controller` |
| `/admin/reports/demand` | Server | Imports `demand.controller` |
| `/admin/reports/responsiveness` | Redirect | → `/admin/reports/health` |
| `/admin/evaluations` | Server | Evaluations hub |

| `/admin/evaluations/rubrics` | Client | Rubric CRUD |
| `/admin/evaluations/reports` | Server | Reports hub |
| `/admin/evaluations/reports/sentiment` | Client | Sentiment analysis chart |
| `/admin/data/users` | Client | User management |
| `/admin/data/users/deleted` | Client | Deleted users list |

| `/admin/audit-trail` | Client | Audit log viewer |
| `/admin/access-config` | Client | Access config list |
| `/admin/access-config/[groupName]` | Client | Group detail editor |
| `/admin/data-management` | Client | Data purge/management |
| `/admin/etl-hub` | Client | ETL import with preview |
| `/admin/user-permissions` | Redirect | → `/admin/access-config` |
| `/dean` | Server | Dashboard — imports services |
| `/dean/departments` | Client | Department course management |
| `/dean/evaluations` | Server | Dean evaluations list |
| `/dean/evaluations/results` | Client | Wraps `EvaluationDashboard` |
| `/dean/evaluations/reports` | Server | Reports hub |
| `/faculty` | Server | Dashboard — imports services |
| `/faculty/upload` | Client | Bulk import uploader |
| `/faculty/availability` | Client | Availability scheduler |
| `/faculty/meetings` | Server | Meetings list |
| `/faculty/meetings/new` | Server | Schedule meeting form |
| `/faculty/meetings/[id]` | Static | Delegates to client `<AppointmentDetail>` |
| `/faculty/reports` | Redirect | → `/admin/reports/health` |
| `/faculty/evaluations` | Client | Evaluation periods list |
| `/faculty/evaluations/[periodId]` | Server | Faculty period breakdown |
| `/faculty/evaluations/results` | Client | Wraps `EvaluationDashboard` |
| `/student` | Server | Dashboard — imports services |
| `/student/book` | Server | Book consultation |
| `/student/history` | Server | Consultation history |
| `/student/meetings` | Server | Meetings list |
| `/student/meetings/[id]` | Static | Delegates to client `<AppointmentDetail>` |
| `/student/evaluations` | Client | Pending evaluations list |
| `/student/evaluations/[id]` | Client | Evaluation form |
| `/student/evaluations/history` | Client | Past evaluations list |
| `/student/evaluations/thank-you` | Static | Thank-you confirmation |

### Known Issues & Risks

1. **Minimal test coverage** — Only 14 test files (166 tests) for ~23,000 LOC. Critical paths remain untested: full report aggregation edge cases, most repository methods, email workflow orchestration edge cases.
2. **HTML email templates via template literals** — Fragile string concatenation. No type safety or template engine.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env` to set up your local environment.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Yes | NextAuth signing secret (generate via `openssl rand -base64 32`) |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Yes | App base URL (`http://localhost:3000` for dev) |
| `AUTH_URL` | No | Alias for NEXTAUTH_URL |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Yes | Supabase service role key |
| `SSO_FEATURE_FLAG` | No | Enable Microsoft Entra ID sign-in |
| `EMAIL_FEATURE_FLAG` | No | Enable email sending via Gmail SMTP |
| `GMAIL_USER` | If email | Gmail address for sending activation emails |
| `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | If email | Gmail app password |
| `FEATURE_CREATE_TEAMS_MEETING` | No | Master toggle for Teams sync features |

## UI Patterns

### Double-Click Prevention

All form submissions and action buttons use `SubmitButton` (`components/ui/SubmitButton.tsx`) which has a built-in `useRef` guard that blocks re-entry for 500ms after the first click, preventing double-submissions even before React re-renders.

### Skeleton Loading

Client-side pages that fetch data on mount show skeleton placeholders (`components/ui/Skeleton.tsx`) instead of "Loading..." text. Variants: `text`, `card`, `table-row`, `avatar`, `metric`, `badge`, plus composite layouts `SkeletonTable`, `SkeletonMetricGrid`, `SkeletonCard`.

### Redirect Guard on Login

The login page checks `useSession()` on mount and auto-redirects already-authenticated users to their role-specific dashboard, preventing them from seeing the login form after session errors or redirects.

### Dark Mode

Class-based strategy: `.dark` class on `<html>` toggles Tailwind `dark:` variants. Persisted in `localStorage` with an inline no-flash script in `<head>`. Sidebar toggle uses sun/moon icons. CSS variable overrides in `globals.css` for custom components.

## Email Delivery via Vercel Workflows

### Architecture

Emails are sent through **Vercel Workflows** (durable execution) with built-in retries per step, surviving deployment restarts and serverless cold starts. On local development the `"use workflow"` / `"use step"` directives are no-ops and functions run as regular async calls.

### Workflow Functions

| Function | Purpose | Steps |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `sendConsultationInviteWorkflow` | Student → Faculty consultation invite | 1 — `sendConsultationInvite` |
| `sendApprovedWorkflow` | Consultation accepted with Teams link | 1 — `sendApprovedWithTeamsLink` |
| `sendPasswordChangedWorkflow` | Password change notification | 1 — `sendPasswordChangedEmail` |
| `sendAppointmentCreatedWorkflow` | Dynamic booking email dispatch | 1 — `sendAppointmentCreatedEmail` |
| `sendConsultationApprovedWorkflow` | Student-booking accepted | 1 — `sendConsultationApprovedEmail` |
| `sendMeetingInviteWithAcknowledgementWorkflow` | Faculty/Dean booking: invite → creator ack | 2 — `sendInviteStep` → `sendAcknowledgementStep` |
| `sendConsultationInviteWithAcknowledgementWorkflow` | Student booking: invite → student ack | 2 — `sendConsultationInviteStep` → `sendAcknowledgementStep` |
| `sendStatusUpdateWorkflow` | Accept/complete/cancel notifications | 1 — `sendStatusUpdateEmail` |

### Email Flows

| Trigger | Recipients | Template | Workflow |
|---------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Student books consultation | Faculty TO + CC attendees | `consultation-invite` | `sendConsultationInviteWithAcknowledgementWorkflow` |
| Student books consultation (ack) | Student | `booking-acknowledgement` (request variant) | ↑ step 2 |
| Faculty/Dean creates meeting | Attendees TO + CC | `meeting-invite` | `sendMeetingInviteWithAcknowledgementWorkflow` |
| Faculty/Dean creates meeting (ack) | Creator | `booking-acknowledgement` (booking variant) | ↑ step 2 |
| Faculty accepts consultation (student-booking) | Student TO, CC faculty + attendees | `consultation-approved` | `sendConsultationApprovedWorkflow` |
| Faculty accepts (self-booking) | Faculty TO, CC attendees | `status-notification` (accepted + creator wording) | `sendStatusUpdateWorkflow` |
| Appointment cancelled | Non-actor participants | `status-notification` (cancelled) | `sendStatusUpdateWorkflow` |
| Appointment completed | Creator TO, CC attendees | `status-notification` (completed + action taken) | `sendStatusUpdateWorkflow` |
| Password changed | User | Inline HTML | `sendPasswordChangedWorkflow` |

### Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `lib/services/email.ts` | Low-level Nodemailer senders (7 functions) |
| `lib/email-templates/*.ts` | HTML templates (5 variants) |
| `lib/workflows/email-workflows.ts` | Durable workflow wrappers (8 functions) |
| `features/appointments/appointments.controller.ts` | Orchestration that invokes workflows |
| `features/reports/*.controller.ts` | 6 report controllers (admin-reports, backlog, coverage, demand, distribution, responsiveness) |
| `features/reports/*.service.ts` | 6 report services (pure helpers only — merge, computeByFaculty, etc.) |

### Prerequisites for Production

- Vercel deployment (Workflows require Vercel infrastructure)
- `VERCEL_ENV` (automatically set on Vercel)
- `"workflow"` dependency in `package.json` (already installed)

## Quick Start

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Run supabase-schema.sql in Supabase SQL Editor (creates all tables + seed data)
# 2. Configure .env with Supabase credentials
# 3. Deploy
```

## Seed Accounts

| Role | Email | Password | Activated |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Admin | admin@lyceumalabang.ph | `a7Kx9mPq4Rz2wY8b` | Yes |
| Dean | regie@itmlyceumalabang.onmicrosoft.com | `password123` | No |
| Faculty | nino_francisco_alamo@itmlyceumalabang.onmicrosoft.com | `password123` | No |
| Student | nin.alamo@outlook.com | `password123` | No |

Non-activated accounts must use the activation flow at `/activate`.
